This tutorial aims to demonstrate how Open OnDemand can be used to host various scientific applications from a central high performance computing (HPC) cluster. Open OnDemand is a web-based portal for accessing HPC services that removes the complexities of HPC system environments from the end-user.  Through Open OnDemand, users can upload and download files, create, edit, submit and monitor jobs, create and share apps, run GUI applications and connect to a terminal, all via a web browser, with no client software to install and configure.
